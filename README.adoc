= DevNation - Social Media Demo

== Introduction

This project contains the material of the demos presented for the talk http://lanyrd.com/2014/devnation14/scxrcf/[Getting Social Media Projects with Apache Camel]
and covering different topics relevant for the business, architect or developer users.

[.big]
* link:#demo1[Get your feets with Social Component and push your data to the browser - demo1]
* link:#demo2[Collect Metrics/Statistics store them and query result - demo2]
* link:#demo3[Design your own dashboard/plugin to report information for the business - demo3]
* Provision your java container using profiles and fabric

NOTE: These demos let you to discover some of the *Business Activity Monitoring* Feature(s) proposed by the *JBoss Fuse* product and the opensource projects
part of that technology : http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel], http://www.elasticsearch.org/[ElasticSearch], http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/[kibana3], http://fabric8.io/[fabric8], https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/master/insight[Insight], http://hawt.io/[hawtio]

== Prerequisites

- http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK 6 or 7]
- http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven 3.0.5 - Software Project Management Tool]
- http://git-scm.com/downloads[Git - Source Code Manager]
- https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/ea/org/jboss/fuse/jboss-fuse-full/6.1.0.redhat-378/[JBoss Fuse 6.1]

== Installation

The code of the project must be downloaded and installed locally on your machine. This process will be achieved by using the
`git clone` command.

- Open a Terminal and move to a directory
- Clone the project

  git clone https://github.com/cmoulliard/devnation-2014-camel.git

- Move to the directory `demo`

  cd demo

- Compile the project using maven

  mvn clean install

When we have compiled the project and deployed the artifacts into our local maven repository, we will install `JBoss Fuse 6.1.x` and
  configure it

- Unzip the file downloaded `jboss-fuse-full-6.1.0.redhat-378.zip`

WARNING: The last digit number *378* of the JBoss Fuse release distribution file will change when the GA release of JBoss Fuse 6.1 will be officially announced.

- Move to the directory created `jboss-fuse-6.1.0.redhat-378`

  cd jboss-fuse-6.1.0.redhat-378

In order to allow the web clients to access to the `Fuse Management Console`, it is required to uncomment the line where the user `admin` is defined into
the file `users.properties`

- Edit the file etc/users.properties to uncomment the line containing #admin=admin,admin
- Move to the bin directory

  cd bin

- Start `fuse` server

  ./fuse or fuse.bat

== Provisioning

Next we will turn on our Fuse Platform into a https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse/6.1/html-single/Fabric_Guide/index.html[Fuse Fabric server] to facilitate the deployment and the configuration of the
different java containers that we will use to play with the demos. When the Fabric server is created a https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse/6.1/html-single/Fabric_Guide/index.html#Arch[Zookeeper server] is installed
locally in your Fuse server which is used to maintain like a DNS, LDAP registry the configurations of the Fuse instances, services deployed, the profiles containing the definitions of the modules (camel, cxf, activemq, ...)
that we can use to provision our instances.

- To install the fabric server, run the following command :

  fabric:create

IMPORTANT: As Fabric is not installed by default with the JBoss Fuse or JBoss AMQ distribution, this additional step is required.

- Open your browser at the following address `http://localhost:8181/index.html` and check that a root container is up and running. The cloud
icon displayed after the root container +++<i class="icon-cloud"></i>+++ with the version number 1.0 means that a Zookeeper server has been deployed and that a default profile
versioned as 1.0 has been provisioned under the root container. By default, the *fuse* and *fabric* profiles are installed and will let our container
to manage the integration stuffs like also the fabric to create new containers, provision them, virtualize the endpoints (camel, cxf, activemq, ...), ...

- Now that the Fuse fabric is working, we will deploy the artefacts (bundles, configuration files, parameters) required into
the registry to play with the demos. This step has been simplified by Fabric as we can create what is called a profile and assign such information.
From that point of view, a profile is nothing more than an envelope containing this following kinds of information:

* The URL locations of the Feature(s) repositories (= XML file)
* A list of Feature(s) to install (= corresponds to a module definition and contains artefacts to be deployed, config file, parameters)
* A list of bundles to install (or, more generally, any suitable JAR packageâ€”including OSGi bundles, Fuse Application Bundles, and WAR files)
* A collection of configuration settings for the OSGi Config Admin service
* Java system properties that affect the Apache Karaf container (analogous to editing etc/config.properties)
* Java system properties that affect installed bundles (analogous to editing etc/system.properties)

For the purpose of this project and the demos we have created 3 different profiles which correspond to a different use case and can be used to
setup a different scenario :

- Twitter / demonstrate *camel twitter* like also *insight/elasticsearch* feature and push data to *websocket* client
- MBean / expose JMX MBean *twitter* services for the camel route, dashboard and plugin
- Plugin / *hawtio plugin* designed for business users to handle their data

The description of the different profiles is defined here after :

[cols="25,75"]
|===
| *Profile Name* | *Description*
| Twitter
| Parent profile(s) : feature-camel insight-core

  Feature(s) :
  	camel-websocket
  	camel-twitter

  Bundle(s) :
  	mvn:org.devnation.demo/camel-twitter/1.0-SNAPSHOT

  Configuration details :

  PID: twitter +
    consumer.key xxxxxxx +
    keywords redhat%20OR%20openshift%20OR%20cloud +
    consumer.secret yyyyyyyyy +
    access.token zzzzzzzz +
    delay 10 +
    access.token.secret vvvvvvvvv

| Plugin
| Parent profile(s) : hawtio

  Bundle(s) :
    	mvn:org.devnation.demo/social-plugin/1.0-SNAPSHOT

| Mbean
| Parent profile(s) : feature-camel

  Feature(s) :
  	  camel

  Bundle(s) :
  	   mvn:org.apache.servicemix.bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.twitter4j/3.0.5_1
  	   mvn:com.google.code.gson/gson/2.2.4
  	   mvn:org.devnation.demo/mbean/1.0-SNAPSHOT

  Configuration details :

  PID: twitter +
    consumer.key xxxxxxxxx +
    consumer.secret yyyyyyyyyy +
    access.token eeeeeeeeeeee +
    access.token.secret zzzzzzzzzzzz
|===

This process to create into the fabric registry the profiles with their corresponding artefacts will be achieved when the Fabric server has been started
and when you will run this maven command under the `demo` directory

  mvn fabric8:deploy -Dfabric8.upload=false

The plugin will use the resources (classes, properties, xml files, ...) created under the target directory like also what has been defined under the src/fabric8
directory to package the bundle, create the profile module definition and push it to the fabric server.

NOTE: More information about the maven plugin `fabric8:deploy` can be find https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/blob/master/docs/mavenPlugin.md[here]
like also how to configure it, define the parameters and use it.

The information published can be retrieved from the Fabric registry using this command executed within the Karaf console :

  fabric:profile-display demo-social-twitter
  fabric:profile-display demo-social-plugin
  fabric:profile-display demo-social-mbean

OR using the `Fuse Management Console`. Then, you must navigate using your browser to the following addresses :

  http://localhost:8181/hawtio/index.html#/wiki/branch/1.0/view/fabric/profiles/demo/social/mbean.profile?cv=1.0
  http://localhost:8181/hawtio/index.html#/wiki/branch/1.0/view/fabric/profiles/demo/social/plugin.profile?cv=1.0
  http://localhost:8181/hawtio/index.html#/wiki/branch/1.0/view/fabric/profiles/demo/social/twitter.profile?cv=1.0

When we deploy the profiles into the Fuse Registry, they are also been published into a local GIT repository.

NOTE: This GIT repository has been added to JBoss Fuse 6.1 to allow not only to upload initial profiles definitions from the folder ($JBOSS_FUSE_HOME/fabric/import/fabric/configs/versions/1.0)
to the registry but to let also the user to maintain the information as a tree structure under the source code management system using the hawtio `wiki`, commit
changes or revert them

[#demo1]
== Demo 1

During this demo, we will demonstrate how we can use one of the Camel social component (twitter), configure it, retrieve data and push them to your browser.


[#demo2]
== Demo 2

Now, that we have been able to collect data/tweets from Twitter, it is important to store the information using Fuse Insight storage
to let next the business users to query the data (Collect Metrics/Statistics store them and query result )

[#demo3]
== Demo 3

In some situations, the business users would be interested that we put in place a dashboard to consult directly the relevant data/information.
Design your own dashboard/plugin to report information for the business
